    rights, with some limitations. Individuals may contact us, at our
    contact information as set forth herein to exercise any of those
    rights and we will respond with the requested action or information,

    regulations to which we are subject. In some cases, the exercise of
    these rights (for example, erasure, objection, restriction or the
    withholding or withdrawing of consent to processing) may make it
    impossible for us to provide services.</P>

    necessary for the purposes for which it was originally collected and
    we do not otherwise have a legitimate reason to retain it. We may
    need to retain certain Personal Data when legally required, for
    internal, record keeping purposes, and/or in order to complete any
    transactions initiated prior to an individual’s request to remove
    or delete their Personal Data. Where we are unable to delete data

    depending on the nature of your inquiry, request, or complaint, we
    may need to verify your identity before implementing your request and
    may require proof of identity, such as in the form of a government
    issued ID and proof of your physical address. We will try to comply
    with your request as soon as reasonably practicable and in any case
    within the timelines prescribed by applicable laws. However, we
    reserve the right to refuse to act on a request that is manifestly
    unfounded or excessive (for example because it is repetitive) and/or,
    in some cases, to charge a fee that takes into account the
    administrative costs for providing the information or the
    communication or taking the action requested.</P>`;
